# Android Quick Start Pack

**⚠️ CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT - NOT READY FOR PUBLIC USE**

This repository contains a curated folder structure and configuration files designed to streamline the setup process for retro gaming on Android handheld devices.

## Current Status

🚧 **Active Development** - This project is being reorganized and will eventually be automated through a companion app.

The current manual setup instructions are being revised and should not be followed at this time.

## What's Included

- Pre-configured folder structure for ROMs and system files
- Obtainium APK for app management (automatically updated via workflows)
- Turnip GPU drivers 
- ES-DE custom system configurations (automatically updated via workflows)

## Automated Workflows

- ES-DE system configurations
